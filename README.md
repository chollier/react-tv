# React TV

A Web Based HLS Playlist Video Player.
It takes `.m3u` master playlists as input and shows the different media items. It can be a list of video clips or even  live TV streams (this is what the app was designed for).
You can either find playlists with clips and live stream on the internet. Alternatively you can build your own, see this [example](example/playlist.m3u)
Works best with Safari.

## Developing and Running

npm install
npm start
```

Then browse `http://localhost:8091`.
